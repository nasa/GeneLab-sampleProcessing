# NOTICE
## The GeneLab Sample Procesing Lab SOPs listed on this repository will no longer be maintained. The SPL is being decommissioned, the repository will remain availble but no updates will be made, as such all documentation should be considered out-dated. 

### About
The NASA GeneLab Sample Processing Laboratory generates open science data from spaceflight missions. Over the years, it has developed a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) that it utilizes to generate high-quality standardized data. This repository houses these SOPs.


## Tissue Storage and Cutting ##
#### [1.1 Sample aliquoting, labeling and storage](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/blob/master/SOP_text/1.1_sample_archiving_v1.0.md) ####
This SOP describes in detail how GeneLab SPL handles sample storage, aliquoting, labeling and the consensus acronyms we use.

#### [1.2 Frozen tissue cutting](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/blob/master/SOP_text/1.2_tissue_cutting_v1.0.md) ####
This SOP describes the steps required to safely section a tissue prior the extraction of nucleic acids. The procedure, if followed correctly will allow portioning a piece of tissue without thawing and compromising the original biological sample.

## Homogenization ##
#### [2.1 Tissue homogenization using Bullet Blender Gold Bead Beater](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/blob/master/SOP_text/2.1_homogenization_bead_beater_v1.0.md) ####
This SOP describes the steps required to lyse and homogenize biological material using a Bullet Blender 24 Gold bead beater. This procedure was validated for downstream RNA/DNA extraction using the Qiagen AllPrep kits (SOP#3.1), it is also possible to use the procedure with downstream RNA extraction using Trizol (SOP#3.2).

#### [2.2 Tissue homogenization using Polytron Rotor Stator Homogenizer](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/blob/master/SOP_text/2.2_homogenization_polytron_v1.0.md) ####
This SOP describes the steps required to homogenize biological samples using the handheld rotor stator homogenizer Polytron. This type of homogenator allow for a larger lysis buffer volume and is used mainly for samples that require larger yield and/or not yet optimized for bead homogenization. This procedure is currently routinely used for mouse skin RNA extraction that requires a downstream Trizol extraction (SOP#3.2).
